            <p class="section-sub">
              Welcome to Magic Math Master — where passion and precision come together to build success in mathematics.
            </p>

            <div class="card">
              <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Founder’s story</h3>

              <p class="section-sub" style="margin-top:0;">
                I was raised in a family with limited means, yet I developed a deep love for mathematics and a strong habit of self-study.
                Although I worked hard, I did not always have access to high-quality expert guidance to help me reach my full potential.
                These early challenges shaped my purpose.
              </p>

              <p class="section-sub">
                I founded Magic Math Master to create opportunities for children who are curious and capable, but may not have the resources
                or support to advance. My goal is to make high-quality mathematics education more accessible through personalised teaching,
                small-group learning, and flexible support options for families.
              </p>

              <p class="section-sub">
                I believe every motivated child deserves the chance to learn deeply, think confidently, and follow their dreams.
              </p>

              <div class="hero-snap-checks" style="margin-top:10px;">
                <span>✓ Calm, simple explanations</span>
                <span>✓ Step-by-step confidence building</span>
                <span>✓ Real-world maths thinking</span>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="card" style="margin-top:16px;">
              <p class="section-sub" style="margin-top:0;">
                As the founder of Magic Math Master, it is my great pleasure to offer an Australian curriculum–aligned mathematics program designed
                to help students build confidence, master foundational skills, and reach their full potential — whether the goal is to catch up,
                extend beyond the classroom, prepare for selective entry or VCE, or simply enjoy the beauty of numbers.
              </p>

              <p class="section-sub">
                Over decades of teaching, researching, and parenting, I’ve learned that true mathematical understanding goes far beyond memorising formulas.
                Mathematics is a universal language of logic and creativity. It helps us make decisions, design technology, understand data, and solve complex
                problems in the real world. Every child can appreciate this “magic” when it is taught clearly, patiently, and in a way that connects to life.

            <h2 class="section-title">📘 Teaching &amp; education background</h2>
            <p class="section-sub">
              My passion for teaching began early, and it has grown through tutoring, classroom teaching, university teaching, and research.
            </p>

            <div class="card">
              <h3 style="margin-top:0;">Early tutoring and proof that progress is possible</h3>
              <p class="section-sub" style="margin-top:0;">
                My passion for teaching began early, when I was still a student myself. Throughout primary and high school, I often helped friends
                understand mathematics more clearly during break time or before class; at times, small groups would even gather at my home so I could
                explain concepts in a calm, simple, and engaging way.
              </p>

              <p class="section-sub">
                During my undergraduate studies, I continued tutoring around 15 students in both one-to-one and small-group sessions.
                One memorable student was a Grade 9 student who had fallen far behind and was at risk of repeating the year. After a few weeks of targeted
                tutoring in Term 3, he rebuilt the background knowledge he needed, became one of the top students in his class by the end of Grade 9,
                and later pursued a degree in Information Technology. This reinforced my belief that with the right guidance, every student can improve.

              <p class="section-sub" style="margin-top:0;">
                Professionally, I have taught mathematics and related subjects in both Vietnam and Australia, including:
              </p>
              <ul class="clean-list">
                <li>🏫 Saigon University (formerly Ho Chi Minh City College of Education)</li>

                <li>🏫 Raffles Vietnam</li>
              </ul>

              <p class="section-sub">
                I also served as a teacher-training lecturer at Saigon University, preparing future secondary mathematics teachers.

              <p class="section-sub" style="margin-top:0;">
                In addition to teaching, I applied my mathematical background to engineering and completed a PhD in Engineering at the University of Melbourne.
                I currently work for an Australian government organisation, where I develop and test tracking algorithms using mathematical modelling,
                logical reasoning, and MATLAB programming. My research publications demonstrate how I use mathematics to derive new formulas and improve
                existing algorithms to solve real-world problems in engineering, industry, and defence.
              </p>

              <p class="section-sub">
                During my PhD, I also taught large-group tutorials, and shortly after completing my doctorate, I was invited to be a guest lecturer in
                Applied Mathematics at the University of Melbourne.
